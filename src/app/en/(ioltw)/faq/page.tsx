                        <p>Of course you can!</p>
                        <p>The only requirement to participate in the TOL is that you must be a student from grade 7 to 12. If you meet this criterion, you&apos;re welcome to give it a try!</p>
                        <p>Unlike other olympiads, the TOL does not require special knowledge of linguistics. What&apos;s needed is clear logical thinking and perseverance in facing challenges. If you&apos;re willing to give it a go, you&apos;re very welcome!</p>

                        <p>We recommend starting with the questions available on our website (no special linguistics knowledge required) or referring to the resources provided in the &quot;Links&quot; section on this page to get a feel for the Olympiad.</p>
                        <p>After practicing, if you develop an interest in linguistics, you can find related books to supplement your knowledge.</p>
                        <p>Refer to <a href="https://www.uklo.org/students-room/">advice from the UK Linguistics Olympiad</a> for more information.</p>

                        <p>Since linguistics problems are quite diverse and each task may vary, it is possible that some problems will require explanations.</p>
                        <p>The scoring method is determined based on the problems and decisions made by the exam committee each year. Generally, points are awarded for completing the specified tasks in the problems.</p>
